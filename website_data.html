                    <p>The Learning Agreement is a contract between you, your home university and the HTWD. The Learning

                    <p>You should discuss the choice of course with your supervisor at your home university and clarify
                        in advance which courses are recognised at your home university or not. The Learning Agreement

                    <p>Language is the key to the culture and society of any country. For everyday life and leisure time
                        in Dresden it is very helpful to pick up a basic knowledge of German. The German language is
                        considered to be somewhat difficult and certainly requiring motivation to learn in the
                        beginning. The reward, however, is that it will smoothen the way into your new environment.</p>
                    <p><strong>LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
                    <p>Students who wish to attend regular courses at the HTW in German and/or English require good to
                        very good <strong>German and/or English language skills (B1/B2)</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>FREE LANGUAGE COURSES&nbsp;</strong><br> The Language Center of HTWD offers free language
                        courses in "German as a Foreign Language (DaF)", English, French and Spanish in the winter and
                        summer semesters. The levels of the language courses are defined on the basis of the Common
                        European Framework of Reference for Languages (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2).&nbsp;If you successfully
                        complete one of these language courses, you can earn ECTS credits for it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In order to take a language course, it is essential that you attend the information sessions
                        during the Welcome Week. You will receive further information on this shortly before the start
                        of the Welcome Week.</p>

                        Please note that your insurance may not cover all costs in Germany. You should therefore make
                        sure that you know exactly which benefits you are entitled to in Germany before you enter the
                        country. You must contact a German statutory health insurance provider and request confirmation
                        that you hold statutory health insurance in your home country&nbsp;and that your health
                        insurance is valid in Germany. Only then you are able to use your health insurance from your

                        provider, you will need your passport and Letter of Admission from HTW Dresden
                        (Zulassungsbescheid). You can secure insurance for the intended period of study from your home
                        country, before arriving in Germany. You do not need an address in Germany or a certificate of
                        enrolment from the university! Your Letter of Admission is sufficient for registration with a
                        statutory health insurance.</p>

                        obtain an exemption from the statutory health insurance obligation.&nbsp;<strong>You can also do

                    <p>If you do not have a bank account in EURO currency, it is necessary to open a German bank account
                        to debit the rent. Normally&nbsp;students are exempt from account maintenance fees.</p>
                    <p>To open an account at a bank, you will need:</p>
                    <ul class="htw_--loaded">
                        <li>passport or national ID card for identification</li>
                        <li>confirmation of registration (“Meldebestätigung”) from the Resident Registration Office in
                            Dresden</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The most common form of a bank account in Germany is a “Girokonto” (giro or check account). Once
                        you have opened a bank account you will receive a debit card, or cash card (“EC-Karte”), which
                        enables you to withdraw cash from the majority of cash machines in Germany and Europe. This is
                        normally free of charge at your own bank’s ATMs and those of the “cash group” or “cash pool”
                        that your bank is affiliated with. Cash machines from other banks will charge you a fee. Many
                        shops allow you to pay for goods and services using the cash card in conjunction with your PIN
                        or signature. Online banking is also available when holding a “Girokonto”.</p>

                    <p><strong>EXAM REGISTRATION</strong></p>
                    <p>All exchange students must register for the exams. To register for the examinations, please send
                        the current version of your learning agreement to the International Office (<a href="#"

                        registration period by e-mail. In addition, please inform the responsible professor/teacher of
                        the course about your participation in the examination before the examination.</p>
                    <p><strong>If you do not register for the exams with your current Learning Agreement, you are not

                        a <em>medical certificate</em>.</p>
                    <p>If an examination date cannot be attended at short notice due to illness, a medical certificate

                        not withdraw from the examination, it will be considered as failed. In the event of failing an

                    <p>For usual visits, call the doctor’s office in advance and make an appointment. For some doctors –
                        even for general practitioners – you might get on a pretty long waiting list. So: In urgent
                        cases (if you are really sick), go to the general practitioner when they open in the morning and
                        wait until they treat you.</p>
                    <p>The doctor gives you prescriptions (Rezept) which you can hand in at the pharmacy to get the
                        right medicine. Some of them have to be paid completely by yourself, for others you just have to
                        add a small fee or they are completely paid by the insurance. During the night, on weekends and
                        holidays there is a <a href="https://home.meinestadt.de/dresden/gesundheit/notdienst-apotheke"

                        or can be reached by ringing the bell at the door. Since the pharmacy in charge of the emergency

                        pharmacy is pointed out on the door or find it in the emergency service schedule of
