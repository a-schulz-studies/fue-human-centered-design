*I*: Perfect. Okay, yeah, then I think we could start with the real deal now. Okay, so the purpose of this interview is to know more about the steps you already took the problems with those steps. I mean, especially for you, you haven't got your visa yet. So everything is scheduled behind. I think that could be a nice topic to talk about. because in the end we don't want to see what the processes currently are in theory but what they are in practice. So you currently are in this situation. You applied for a visa and stuff and you already had some issues with it. And I hope to improve it later on. Yeah, so maybe that's a good icebreaker. Could you tell me what's the issue that you haven't got your visa yet?

*B*: So, regarding the visa, recently German consulate and embassy, I think they are not releasing the visa slots as much as they wish to release before. So that's the major reason. Yeah. And the students are facing the consequences for it. So I would suggest German government, please improve this system, because the students are facing a lot. The bachelor students, the master students, they are told by the university to defer their semesters. And the one who doesn't have the option to defer the semesters, they are told to again apply next year. So this is the major. Yeah, that's bad.

*I*: That's really bad. Okay, I didn't know about this issue. So was applying for the visa your first step you took when preparing for your exchange studies or what did you already do?

*B*: So the first step was that I sort listed out the universities. Then I got yeah, I sort listed around seven to eight university. I had a good. Yeah. Am I audible?

*I*: Yeah, you're audible.

*B*: Yeah. So the first step was that I sort of started the university. Seven to eight universities last year. I think it was during November or December time period. I had a good score in bachelor's so I just tried to go with the 7 to 8 university. I applied there and I received admission from two of the universities. And I was in waiting list for two of the universities and got rejection from three of the universities. So that was because of the credit. I did not match the credit system that is already in Europe. right so one was the acceptance was from one was from i think it was from uh it's near about uh wildau technical university of wildau i think yeah one was wildau and the other is the dresden one htw dresden so i thought of going with htw dresden so after that i received the admission i got I got enrolled and now I am waiting for my visa. And even I applied for my dormitory in August and by the mid of September I was assigned with dormitory. So these are the process that I have already done with, I have completed.

*I*: So first of all you applied for the university, you searched for university then you applied, then you already searched for accommodation in Dresden?

*B*: Yes. Yeah, and I got the enrollment. Yeah, I have my visa interview on 31st of October.

*I*: Okay, but did you already face some other issues while applying at the universities other than the The credit score not matching with one of your home universities?

*B*: So before applying to Germany, I was searching about many other countries. And the best is that German university and their university portal. They are the excellent one. They have provided each and every information regarding the course, the modules and the career prospectives. So I didn't have a hard time while choosing my course or selecting my course. So it was the best thing that I have faced. There were no any challenges. You can say, with all the documentation and all, that would be manageable. That is manageable.

*I*: What do you think, how much time did you already spend on all the processes Or maybe you could divide for searching for university searching for courses and searching for accommodation and stuff

*B*: So for me it was around a year I took. Okay. Almost a year. Yeah. So the first month, one and a half months or two months. Yeah. I spent in searching the university. Yeah. Then then searching the models and all matching the modules and all my course modules that if that is suitable for me or not. So I spent around two to three months in that. Yeah. And then after that, usually the application for winter semester starts. I think it's in April. Yeah. During the month of Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So until I think it's until July, then the application process goes until July. Yeah. And that is around three to four months. Yeah, the application process takes around three to four months, then we get the rejection or the acceptance within, you can call say around one month. We start getting the acceptance, I think in August. Yeah. August and September. That is how I divided the time.

*I*: But isn't that quite bad that you are getting the notification that you are accepted in August when you still have to choose for accommodation and for your visa? Wouldn't it be better if you got the notification earlier that you are accepted and that you can study the next semester in Germany?

*B*: That totally depends upon the country's policy that you cannot change anything. I think Germany has that policy. So I think being an international student, we are to follow that rules. So I think it's a bit hectic. Yeah. After getting the acceptance letter, we don't have much time. We are in rush to apply for the visa and financial statements and all. So it's a bit challenging. But yes, being international student, you got to manage that. however.

*I*: And did you got any support any any contact persons you could contact when you had any issues or where did you got the basic information from your home University so you can.

*B*: So basically I searched on DARD there's a website called DARD yeah and you have the university yeah you have all the information of the University is there and even the uni assist portal. They are the best ones. Yeah, they have each and every course course over there. So as per the requirement, you can apply there. And during the application process, if I had any query or anything, I just mail them and even to the university's professor personally. Yeah, and they used to reply. So it was great.

*I*: Okay, that sounds nice because I know that my university has this online page where all the steps are listed, what you have to do before the semester, after the semester starts and at the end of the semester. Like a little checklist where you only have to follow the steps and then you're basically fine. You don't have to do your own research.

*B*: That is what German university is best for. They will provide with the detailed information.

*I*: I am not sure the formulas you had to fill out. Were they mailed to you or did you just download them online? Or were they on online site where you could enter all your information and apply for the universities?

*B*: So basically the international students need to follow the uni assist portal. They are the third party. If you have any information regarding the uni assist. They are the third party. They are the third party. They are merged up with the university. And basically all the international students apply there. So directly there are there are very few universities that we can apply directly to the university. Otherwise, we need to come through the uni-assist portal. We need to upload our documents, which and everything over there, the language requirements, the transcript and all that. And they will forward it to the university if our requirement matches.

*I*: OK. That sounds quite convenient. So you just have to enter all everything in one portal and you don't have to let each university separately. separately. Yeah okay have you already planned on doing a German language course or have you already done one or is it just required to be good in English B2 or C level or what the requirement

*B*: Basically my course is totally an English based program Once I had enrolled in German classes during it was I think around July and even I was working yeah I was full-time employed at that time so I took around two months and then it was not possible for me managing the safety and taking the classes cooking for myself so I dropped the classes and The best thing is that in my course German Business and International Management, I do have a language.

*I*: Ah you have?

*B*: Yeah, so they will be teaching German A1. That is the best thing.

*I*: Yeah, I think the A1 course is quite good because it's not not only about the language but it's It's also about the culture and stuff. I guess so that might be interesting. Yeah. Okay. What else is on my list? Was it required when you... I remember from my starting times when I applied at the HDW Dresden I had to send all my documents per mail. Was it necessary for you or was it just online at the Uni-Assist-Portal and then it was forwarded or did you have to sign it on paper and send it per mail to the university and stuff?

*B*: Yeah, so for the resident, STW resident, what I need to do that the enrollment paper, right? I downloaded them. Yeah, that was the requirement. and I had to download them from the portal and then sign it, then courier it back to the university. So I think that was not needed at all. That was a big, I think hectic one because as we already have enrolled and all. So again, signing the documents, sending to president by courier, that was not relevant for me at all. But yeah, again, being an international student. Yeah, I got to follow. Yeah.

*I*: Yeah, that's true. Okay, so I have one thing more on my not only one thing more, but we can talk about. So your goal here at the university then is just to study or is it also? I think I yeah, maybe I can elaborate a little bit. I also did an exchange studies half a year ago. And for me it was Yeah, studying is great. and it's interesting but it's also more about the culture and being in a different country and having the free time there and spending time with other people. Is that also part of your interest in coming to Germany or is it just studying and then?

*B*: No, so being an international student yeah that is the plus point that we got to learn about the other culture, basically the German culture and the international students culture and to say my culture. So that will be also be my part and Roman own Germany, understand Germany in most more better way and also visit the nearby countries that is near Germany. Yeah okay so

*I*: so you also want to travel a little bit then when we're when you're coming to Germany yeah yeah Have you already checked for some information about traveling around Europe and from Germany to the neighbor countries?

*B*: Ah. Yeah, so the nearest. country by Dresden. I think it's the Paraguay thing.

*I*: Yeah, yeah, it's a Czech Republic.

*B*: Yeah, so I think it's a two hour train ride. I think yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so I thought of traveling there and maybe later on to the nearby country that is I think the The other one is Poland i think?

*I*: Yes. Yeah. Okay. So I think you're quite independent by choosing all the universities and following all the processes. Did you ever have the feeling of needing more support from a university or from

*B*: I was totally focused on the support given by university only I used to mail them whenever I got confused and they used to reply that yeah you got to follow these steps yeah you will find this material over here you can look over that yeah so they were assisting a lot i never had a feeling that i need to go to a consultant or a consultancy and consult with them yeah so it was quite an independent process because i earlier i told you that for germany they have mentioned each and everything on the portal the university portal yeah regarding the course modules and each and everything so it's far better easy yeah for a student for the international student to apply in Germany okay that sounds nice

*I*: yeah yeah so overall you are quite satisfied with the process how it went and

*B*: yeah very much satisfied

*I*: Okay, I think for maybe we already talked about nearly everything I have on my list and I don't want to steal any more of your time. Maybe it's even better if we can reschedule another meeting so I can like summarize everything we talked about today and then identify the gaps I still have and

*B*: for sure.

*I*: Write new questions. Because it's quite overwhelming while asking all the questions and taking notes and stuff. I'm not doing interviews all the days. And I'm not very practiced on doing these things. Or do you have any improvement ideas on your mind already? How we could improve the processes and ..?

*B*: There are few. I would like to request the German Consulate and The German embassy. Just to focus on the visa slots. The international students are applying. They need to get the slots. They don't need to defer the semester or apply next year. Doing that, they will be losing their interest and time. The German embassy and consulate should focus on this one. This is the suggestion I would like to give them otherwise they are perfect.

*I*: Okay. I'm not sure if I can change anything related to the visa enrollment and process and the amount of slots but I can check if there is something related to this process that would make it easier but I'm not sure

*B*: You can suggest them this.

*I*: You said you're arriving in Dresden mid-November, right? We could also meet in person then, when you are in Dresden. Yeah, if possible. For sure. Yeah, we can check that after I arrive. Perfect. So thank you very much for your time. I don't want to and longer this meeting anymore because what was quite very very helpful already okay I just disconnected okay yeah some technical stuff I was okay yeah but it's Everything is working again. I will let you know if I need any more information from you. For sure you can text me just on my number. I will be there. Thank you for having me. You are very helpful actually. Yeah, and let me say my experience right. Yeah. I hope you'll have a good time in your research work. Thank you very much. Yeah. Okay, have a nice day and hopefully everything works out for you. Yeah. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye. you
