More and more governments around the world pursue this phenomenon hoping to reduce costs, improve services for citizens and to increase effectiveness and efficiency in the public sector. E-government represents a fundamental change in the whole public sector structure, values, culture and the ways of conducting business. It is about a radical change within government and in the relationship between a government and its citizens. However, e-government adoption is surrounded by political, cultural, organisational, technological and social issues which must be considered and treated carefully to enable this transformation. Therefore, there is no universal model for e-government adoption which can be applicable for all countries to ensure success.},

  author = {Ego Aguirre Luján, Elizabeth},
  date = {2019-07-25},
  abstract = {Recent events have put the Estonian e-government at proof. In 2017 the international community suffered several cybernetic attacks, three of them were serious enough to turn on the alarms in develop and developing countries. Among these threats, the ransomware attacks marked cyber-defense concerns over last year. Ransomware viruses like Wannacry, Mamba or Petya, encrypts sensible information in order to blackmail those affected. Hacking activities have also revealed the vulnerabilities of governments. The self-denominated Shadow Brokers hackers have filtrated defense information of the NSA (National Security Agency) and have made public the weaknesses of Windows and iOS systems. In the same way, the filtration of Vault 7 from Wikileaks, have arose again the question about how to protect government information related to intelligence and defense. Although many of the great powers suffered this attacks, the small Baltic State of Estonia remained unaffected. The answer lays on the governance system that this country has developed since 2007, which have turn its bureaucracy into one of the most efficient and safe systems, near the ideal that Max Weber proposed in the first decades of the last century. In Politics as a Vocation, Weber points out that "the bureaucratic state order is especially important; in its most rational development, it is precisely the characteristic of the modern state"1. Towards the second decade of the XXI century, the concept of modern State needs to be redefined, starting from the actual examples of countries which have implemented digital technology in its governance. The Estonian process begun in 2007, when a public web platform was launched for citizens to vote on different ideas concerning public policy. Since then, this process has advance to the point in which it has become "the most ambitious project in technological statecraft today, for it includes all members of the government, and alters citizens' daily lives"2. Indeed, citizens lives have been altered in a way that effectively involve them with the State administration, not in a relation of servants and servitors, but as a compromised whole. Today-except the ones referred to physical property-all bureaucratic processes in Estonia can be done online. "Although it does not have a e-government strategy, nor did it create a special office or ministry for information society, the Estonian approach has seen implementation as the key, and no need for writing excessive documents and creating additional layers of bureaucracy. Estonian e-government implementation has been fairly successful without such documents and formalized cooperation between institutions, while many other countries, which at least formally, have adopted such documents and formalized cooperation, does not score that well on the e-government rankings"3. Just to give an example, the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs refers that "An entrepreneur may create a company in Estonia through a completely 'bureaucracy-free' process directly at his personal computer. The e-business portal's record for the setup and registration of a company is 18 minutes. Creating a company via the internet requires only an Estonian ID card"4. Weber suggests that bureaucracy is the most rational, effective and efficient scheme of administration.},

This research focuses on achieving high usability and user experience by improving and applying the human centered design activities on the software development process. For this purpose we proposed our HCD model and a PSC (People using Software in a Context) analysis for achieving the good user experience and integrate it with the human centered design process to ensure high usability. This research will investigate on how applying HCDP influence software development process in order to improve usability and the quality of user experience. We have developed a simple calculator application to see the impact of applying our HCD model to SDP and identify issues with and without following our proposed HCD model. Results revealed that proposed HCD model is good to answer the issues identified in the conventional software development process.},

  abstract = {We write emails, listen to music online, pay an invoice through internet banking, and have an eID. These all are e-services. But how can we define an e-service? Numerous definitions of e-services generalize their essence, reflect the specific characteristics and certain elements of their production process. They are important for economic theory and practice, but none of them have acquired general acceptance. Supranational institutions, scientists and researchers attempt to seek one definition. A lot of definitions explain e-services only as e-government, e-learning and e-commerce. It is insufficient for further classification. We pay attention to classification of e-services in this chapter. Some of them divided e-services according to the branch, processes etc. Classification as e-co model, e-ladder, E-Diamond model, classification of service and product to the dimensions in a 2 * 2 matrix, and fulfilment-product classification have been introduced. The main goal of our study is to provide an extensive review of e-service definitions and classifications. Based on the findings we propose our own classification of e-services. The result of our work is a new 3D model. The 3D model is constructed according to bases of stages models and Diamond model, but we respect also user's needs and their fulfilment in process. In this empirical analysis of e-service definitions and classifications, we have compared known definitions and classifications and proposed a new model. Most models and schemes only deal with public e-services. We bring a new perspective, the classification is intended for all known e-services.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Estonia’s transition to free-market capitalism and liberal democracy is marked by three distinct features: economic success, digital transformation of its public sector, and a rapid increase and persistence of social inequality in Estonia. Indeed, Estonia has become one of the most unequal societies in Europe. Economic success and increasing social inequality can be explained as different sides of the same coin: a neoliberal policy mix opened markets and allowed globalization to play out its drama on a domestic stage, creating winners and losers. Yet Estonia has been highly successful in its digital agenda. Particularly interesting is how the country’s public sector led the digital transformation within this highly neoliberal policy landscape. While within economic policy, Estonia did indeed follow the famed invisible hand in rapidly liberalizing markets, in ICT, Estonia seems to have followed an entirely different principle of policymaking. In this domain, policy has followed the principle of the hiding hand, coined by Albert Hirschman: policy-makers sometimes take on tasks they think they can solve without realizing all the challenges and risks involved— and this may result in unexpected learning and creativity. The success of Estonia’s e-government has much to do with the principle of the hiding hand: naïvety and optimism propelled initial ‘crazy ideas’ in the early 1990s to become ingrained in ICT policy, enabling the creation of multiple highly cooperative and overlapping networks that span public–private boundaries.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted by public sector organizations to provide better public services and to transform their internal processes. AI is now considered a key enabler for digital innovation and transformation in the public sector. However, AI is still relatively a new research area in the field of digital government. The term, AI, captures a wide range of technologies, techniques, and tools such as machine/deep learning, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and more recently Generative AI. While these AI technologies afford different applications and benefits in the government context, they also create social, ethical, and legal challenges. These challenges require solutions combining both technical (e.g., data and algorithmic solutions to minimize bias) and institutional (e.g., governance structures and processes) mechanisms. The special issue is a collection of articles that contribute to a better understanding of the issues associated with AI deployment in different areas of government operations. They cover AI applications in the areas of emergency response, policy analysis, public bids, and citizen participation. The contributions also address the challenge of realizing a legal transparency regime for AI in government and the effect of AI in bureaucratic decision-making.},

Europe is now and will be in 2060 the oldest continent in the world, so elderly is an important target group for future m-government services. There are several m-government initiatives and projects offering various government services, like information sharing, alerting and mHealth services, which provide mobile remote patient monitoring in order to measure vital signs, bio-signals of patients outside hospital environments. Such systems can strongly benefit from improved acceptance by elderly users; therefore, investigation of social and psychological aspects of mobile adoption is an emerging field of research. The goal of our research is to find a way to map the needs of the elderly and set guidelines for the design of m-government systems. We apply IGUAN framework [11] for usability investigation, which we developed, in our earlier research as a guideline for improving the usability of e-government systems. We constructed a scenario in usability investigation, a search for medical treatment. Our research follows a user-driven method and uses the data acquired on usability of m-government by the elderly from Germany and Hungary. The main contribution of this paper is the assessment of the requirements for m-government systems’ development for elderly, by investigating the factors, which lead to a low acceptance of m-government by this group.},

  abstract = {In light of the increasing importance of citizen-centricity in public services, one approach technologically advanced public organizations take is to integrate proactivity into their services. Scholars agree with the potential for proactivity in public services and study some aspects of the topic, and some publications deal with the concept of proactivity itself. However, opinions regarding the characteristics of proactive public services diverge in both research and practice, and despite—or maybe because of—the growing body of research, the literature still lacks conceptual clarity. We address this issue by developing a taxonomy for proactive public services using Nickerson, Varshney, and Muntermann's (2013) taxonomy-development method. Using eight empirical and conceptual iterations that draw on a structured literature review, two semi-structured interviews, investigation of 67 real-world objects, and an evaluation with nine potential users, we propose a taxonomy of eight dimensions and 23 characteristics. The outcome of this work enriches scientific knowledge about digital government by detailing the concept of a proactive public service and serving as a basis for further research. Moreover, practitioners can be inspired by the 23 characteristics of proactive public services to identify possible next steps in the design of their services, such as determining which proactive public services are feasible and in what form. In addition to the taxonomy, our collection of 67 practical examples of proactive public services from a variety of countries contributes to digital government research and practice.},

  abstract = {This paper responds to two observations about current government service delivery. First, despite reasonable efforts to improve the design of forms and to establish single points of contact in one-stop shops, citizens still perceive forms as cumbersome. Second, citizens expect governments to act proactively by initiating appropriate government services themselves, instead of relying on requests for services from citizens. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a transition from a one-stop shop to a no-stop shop, where the citizen does not have to perform any action or fill in any forms to receive government services. The contribution of this paper is an e-government stage model that extends existing models. Stage models are suitable tools with which to inspire future developments, and ours extends previous models that guide progress toward the one-stop shop by describing two further stages: the limited no-stop shop and the no-stop shop. We define three dimensions along which to progress: integration of data collection, integration of data storage, and purpose of data use. We provide a first test of the model's validity through three case studies: the e-government practices in Austria, Estonia, and an Australian state government. Our work complements existing research on e-government stage models and proactive government service delivery.},

  abstract = {Estonia eID is officially a part of the critical infrastructure. 2/3 of citizens regularly use eID today to access thousands of e-services. To examine the eID public acceptance, we conducted a survey among Estonian eID users to find out which of the existing eID authentication options are preferred and why. We present the results and interpret the data with a set of pre-defined eID public acceptance factors.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a literature review that has the main goal to examine what are the factors that are affecting eID public acceptance. We are specifically interested in the perspectives of end-users and the matter of their attitudes towards eID. Our search yielded a rather narrow but concrete range of sources. Among the main themes of interest presented in the literature, we identify factors that are further synthesized in twelve categories. Moreover, we interpret the factors in their original context which allows for understanding which of the factors are mentioned as either drivers, barriers, or both. Based on the analysis of scientific narratives, we point to disparities detected in the existing knowledge of influential factors of eID public acceptance and outline areas that require further research.},
