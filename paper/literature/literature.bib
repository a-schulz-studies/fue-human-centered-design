  abstract = {Human centered design involves human perspective at every stage of the development process. This paper encompasses the impact of applying human-centered design process (HCDP) to the software development process (SDP). Applying human centered design process to the software development process needs to focus on human factors involved to enhance the usability and for effective user experience. This research focuses on achieving high usability and user experience by improving and applying the human centered design activities on the software development process. For this purpose we proposed our HCD model and a PSC (People using Software in a Context) analysis for achieving the good user experience and integrate it with the human centered design process to ensure high usability. This research will investigate on how applying HCDP influence software development process in order to improve usability and the quality of user experience. We have developed a simple calculator application to see the impact of applying our HCD model to SDP and identify issues with and without following our proposed HCD model. Results revealed that proposed HCD model is good to answer the issues identified in the conventional software development process.},
